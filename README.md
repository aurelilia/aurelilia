## Hi there!

I'm Ellie (pronouns she/they). I enjoy programming as a hobby.

Most of my projects are primarily hosted on my [Gitea](https://git.angm.xyz/ellie),
only finished projects tend to be mirrored here on GitHub.

The languages I would consider myself proficient in are Rust, Kotlin and Java, with
intermediate-level skills in Python/Django and Webdev with HTML, SASS and Vue.js.
