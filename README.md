## Hewwo!

I'm Leela and also go by aurelia (pronouns it/they/she). I enjoy programming as a hobby,
with a particular interest in anything low-level - from emulators over
programming languages to operating systems.  
Lately, I've mainly been working on [GameGirl](https://github.com/aurelilia/gamegirl), a GB and GBA emulator
with a DS core currently underway.

Most of my projects are primarily hosted on my [Forgejo](https://forge.catin.eu/leela),
though contributions on GitHub are welcome and appreciated.

The languages I would consider myself proficient in are Rust, Kotlin and (sadly) Java, with
intermediate-level skills in Python/Django and Webdev with HTML, SASS and Vue.js.
