## Hi there!

I'm Leela and also go by aurelia (pronouns they/she). I enjoy programming as a hobby,
with a particular interest in anything low-level - from emulators over
programming languages to operating systems.  
Lately, I've mainly been working on [GameGirl](https://github.com/anellie/gamegirl), a GB and GBA emulator.

Most of my projects are primarily hosted on my [Gitea](https://git.elia.garden/ellie),
only finished projects tend to be mirrored here on GitHub.

The languages I would consider myself proficient in are Rust, Kotlin and (sadly) Java, with
intermediate-level skills in Python/Django and Webdev with HTML, SASS and Vue.js.
